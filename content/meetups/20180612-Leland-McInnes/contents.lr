Dimension reduction is the task of finding a low dimensional representation of high dimensional data. This has uses
as a visualisation technique (by reducing to 2 or 3 dimensions), and as a pre-processing step for further
machine learning tasks, such as clustering, or classification. This talk will provide an overview of different
approaches to dimension reduction, looking at more recent approaches like t-SNE, before introducing a new algorithm
called UMAP.

The talk will provide an introduction to dimension reduction in general, before building the theory that motivates
UMAP, explaining how the algorithm works. Next, we will look at the implementation details including how
Numba allows the implementation to be both efficient, and highly flexible (supporting custom distance metrics).
Finally the talk will discuss how future versions of UMAP will support semi-supervised dimension reduction,
and potentially operate directly on arbitrary pandas dataframes.
