body:

PyData Ann Arbor is a group for amateurs, academics, and professionals
currently exploring various data ecosystems. Specifically, we seek to engage
with others around analysis, visualization, and management. We are primarily
focused on how Python data tools can be used in innovative ways but also
maintain a healthy interest in leveraging tools based in other languages such
as R, Java/Scala, Rust, and Julia.
