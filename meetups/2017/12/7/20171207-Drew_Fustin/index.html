  <p>Although ideal experimental design involves hypothesis testing with randomized controlled trials on concurrent populations to minimize selection bias
and convoluting variables, it often arises that experiments cannot be run on variant populations simultaneously -- for instance, when a stimulus
necessarily impacts the entire population at a specific point in time (as in measuring a non-digital ad campaign's effectiveness).  Dealing
with these situations is common in the social sciences, where the method of Interrupted Time Series Analysis is commonly used. In order to
measure the effect size of a stimulus in situations such as these, we have to consider many convoluting factors caused by our populations being
non-concurrent before deriving meaning from the experimental results.</p>
<p>In this Python-based tutorial, we will walk through a Monte Carlo-generated experiment measuring the lift induced
by a simulated ad campaign. By the end of this tutorial, you will understand many complicating factors that could lead to
faulty conclusions being drawn from the experimental results. However, you will also learn how best to design experiments and
interpret results to mitigate these risks and take proper account of irreducible convoluting factors.</p>

at SpotHero, focusing primarily on optimizing acquisition marketing spend and balancing supply and demand to generate
inventory and rate recommendations. He's also worked for GrubHub as the insights analyst, turning food facts into media
content for the PR department and transforming data into actionable initiatives within the organization. He was also a
data scientist with Digital H2O, a SaaS startup providing water intelligence for the oil/gas industry. He holds a PhD in physics
from the University of Chicago, where he studied dark matter by looking for tiny bubbles in a chamber over a mile
underground in a Canadian nickel mine.</p>
