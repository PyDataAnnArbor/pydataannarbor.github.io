  <p><em>This event is co-hosted with the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Machine-Learning-Data-Science-and-Industry/">Ann Arbor Machine Learning Meetup</a> group.</em></p>
<p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the open-source TensorFlow library
for deep learning. What's so great about TensorFlow is that it allows us to
work with multi-dimensional arrays and train deep neural network very
efficiently by utilizing GPU resources.</p>
<p>In this introduction to TensorFlow, you will learn how to define computational
graphs and how to execute them in a Python runtime environment. After
implementing backpropagation for a simple multi-layer perceptron, we will talk
about TensorFlow's convenience features for optimization and the new layers API
to construct more complex deep learning architectures more compactly. Finally,
we will implement a General Adversarial Networks architecture to see how we can
access and update variables from different network graphs and scopes -- the
entry point for inventing and experimenting with novel architectures in our
real-world applications and research.</p>
<p>As a Ph.D. candidate at Michigan State University, Sebastian Raschka is
developing novel computational methods in the field of computational biology.
Among others, his research activities include the development of new deep
learning architectures to solve problems in the field of biometrics.</p>
<p>Among his other works is his book “Python Machine Learning,” a bestselling
title at Packt and on Amazon.com, which has been translated into German,
Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and Italian. In his free time, Sebastian loves to
contribute to open source projects, and methods that he implemented are now
successfully used in machine learning competitions such as Kaggle.</p>
