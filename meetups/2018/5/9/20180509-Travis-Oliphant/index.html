  <p>NumPy is the foundation of array computing in Python. However, it has many known limitations including a
difficult to extend type-system, and a function system that is difficult to extend to other types. Over the
past decade, other Python run-times and other languages have tried to mimic NumPy behavior and more recently
many machine learning frameworks have created more array concepts that are not necessarily compatible with
each other. XND is a set of libraries and concepts that can unify the foundations of computing with typed
containers across languages. It builds on the lessons of NumPy while generalizing it's core features into
re-usable libraries. In this talk, I will describe the need for XND and discuss it's progress and roadmap.</p>
